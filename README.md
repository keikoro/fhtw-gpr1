# FHTW GPR1

Various small (beginner) C scripts.   
C homework for my CS studies, winter term 2013/14.


See code comments for descriptions of individual programs.


## Usage 

Compile the code using the command:

```
$ gcc -std=c99 -Wall INFILE -o OUTFILE
```

and run the resulting executable with:

```
$ ./OUTFILE
```

The `-Wall` flag is optional and will print out warnings.  

You can also leave `OUTFILE` off, which will result in the executable getting saved as `a.out` in the folder where the C script resides.
